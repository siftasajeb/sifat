About CSE
Tmss Technical Institute’s mission is defined by its IT-based traditions of service and access. To upheld, TTI started with the department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in January 24, 2002. After that, Faculty of science and Information Technology started two more programs: Computer Science (CS) and Computing and Information System (CIS). </br></br></br>

The department of CSE, CIS & CS has produced more than 350 graduates to contribute in the national ICT development. At present, there are twelve batches of students are studying here. The bachelor program in CSE, CIS and CS are designed to produce skilled graduates in the field to satisfy the growing demands of graduates in home and abroad. These Programs provide the students an opportunity to obtain a broad knowledge in Computer Science, Computer Engineering with some scope to tailor the program according to the student’s individual needs</br></br></br>

The departments of CSE, CIS & CS, now offer two programs— Master of science in CSE and Management Information Systems (MS/MIS). These two programs aim at not only providing modern and practical education in CSE and MIS but also preparing the students as well-groomed professionals to meet the demand of national and international ICT.

<h1>WHY STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE?</h1>
The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving, an essential skill for life. Students study the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business, scientific and social contexts. Because computers solve problems to serve people, there is a significant human side to computer science as well.
